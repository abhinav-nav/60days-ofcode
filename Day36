1.Russian Doll Envelopes

You are given a 2D array of integers envelopes where envelopes[i] = [wi, hi] represents the width and the height of an envelope.

One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the other envelope's width and height.

Return the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other).

Note: You cannot rotate an envelope.

 

Example 1:

Input: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).

2. Walls And Gates

Problem statement
You are given a matrix having ‘N’ rows and ‘M’ columns. Each cell of the matrix can only contain three values as given below:

-1 -> It denotes a wall or an obstacle

0  -> It denotes a gate

2^31 - 1 =  2147483647 ( INF ) -> An infinitely large value  denotes the empty room.

For each empty room (denoted by INF), you have to refill it with the distance to its nearest gate. If none of the gates is 
reachable from an empty room then the value ‘INF’ will remain as it is.
Example
For the matrix [[0,-1],[0,2147483647]] the updated matrix will be [[0,-1],[0,1]].
Note
The distance between two cells having their coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are abs(x2-x1) + abs(y2-y1).
