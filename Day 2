Day 2: Sorting and Searching

1.Easy Problem: Selection Sort Implementation

Problem Statement:
Implement the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

Input:
An array of integers.

Output:
The sorted array.

Example:
Input:
[5, 3, 8, 2, 7, 1, 6, 4]
Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

2. Problem: Binary Search Implementation

Problem Statement:
Write a function to perform a binary search on a sorted array of integers to find a target element.

Input:
A sorted array of integers and a target element.

Output:
The index of the target element if found, or -1 if not found.

Example:
Input:
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
Target: 7
Output:
Index: 3

3.Problem : Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)

Problem Statement:
Given two strings, find the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS).

Input:
Two strings.

Output:
The length of the longest common subsequence.

Example:
Input:
String 1: "ABCBDAB"
String 2: "BDCAB"
Output:
Length of LCS: 4 (LCS: "BCAB")
