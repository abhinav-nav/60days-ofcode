1.Rat in a maze

Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach the destination at (N – 1, N – 1). 
Find all possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination. The directions in which the rat can move are 
‘U'(up), ‘D'(down), ‘L’ (left), ‘R’ (right). Value 0 at a cell in the matrix represents that it is blocked and the rat cannot move to 
it while value 1 at a cell in the matrix represents that rat can travel through it.

Note: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time.

Print the answer in lexicographical(sorted) order

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
m[][] = {{1, 0, 0, 0},
        {1, 1, 0, 1}, 
        {1, 1, 0, 0},
        {0, 1, 1, 1}}

Output: DDRDRR DRDDRR

The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths - DRDDRR and DDRDRR, when printed in sorted order we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.

Example 2:

Input: N = 2
       m[][] = {{1, 0},
                {1, 0}}

Output:
 No path exists and the destination cell is blocked.

2. Last Stone Weight II

ou are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.
Example 2:

Input: stones = [31,26,33,21,40]
Output: 5
