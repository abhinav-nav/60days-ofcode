Day 24: Trees and Graphs

1. Problem: Symmetric Tree

Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

Input:
The root of a binary tree.

Output:
True if the binary tree is symmetric, otherwise false.

Example:
Input:
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
Output:
True

2. Problem: Clone Graph

Problem Statement:
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Input:
A reference of a node in the graph.

Output:
The reference of the cloned graph.

Example:
Input:
Graph:
    1---2
    |   |
    4---3
Output:
Cloned Graph:
    1---2
    |   |
    4---3

 2.Problem: Number of Islands

Problem Statement:
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Input:
An m x n 2D binary grid grid.

Output:
The number of islands.

Example:
Input:
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output:
1
