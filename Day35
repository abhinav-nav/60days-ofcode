1. Minimum Knight Moves

In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction,
then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y].  It is guaranteed the answer exists.

Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] â†’ [2, 1]

2. Box Stacking Problem

You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the i^th box has height h(i), width w(i)
and depth d(i) (all real numbers). 
You want to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another
box if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the 
lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box.
Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side functions as its base. It is also allowable to use multiple 
instances of the same type of box. 

Input:

bars = 3 (number of bars)

Bar dimensions:
* Bar 1: (length x width x height) = (2 x 1 x 4)
* Bar 2: (length x width x height) = (3 x 2 x 1)
* Bar 3: (length x width x height) = (1 x 4 x 2)
Output:

Maximum Height = 5
