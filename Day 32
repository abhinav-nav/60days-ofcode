1.  Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]

2. 
Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to 
the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [0]


Output: [0]

3. Set Matrix Zeroes

Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.

Example 1-
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
