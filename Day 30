1. Egg Dropping Puzzle | DP-11

	
The following is a description of the instance of this famous puzzle involving N = 2 eggs and a building with K = 36 floors. 
Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 36-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to 
break on landing. We make a few assumptions:
  
* An egg that survives a fall can be used again. 
* A broken egg must be discarded. 
* The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs. 
* If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor. 
* If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall. 
* It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that the 36th-floor does not cause an egg to break.
If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be carried out in only one way. 
Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. In the 
worst case, this method may require 36 droppings. Suppose 2 eggs are available. What is the least number of egg droppings that are guaranteed 
to work in all cases?  The problem is not actually to find the critical floor, but merely to decide floors from which eggs should be dropped 
so that the total number of trials is minimized.

Note: In this post, we will discuss a solution to a general problem with ‘N’ eggs and ‘K’ floors

2. Integer to Roman 

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. 
  The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. 
Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle
applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
Example 2:

Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
