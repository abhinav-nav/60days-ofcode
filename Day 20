Day 20: Dynamic Programming
1. Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Problem Statement:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Input:
An array prices where prices[i] is the price of the stock on the ith day.

Output:
The maximum profit that can be achieved.

Example:
Input:
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output:
5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

2. Problem: Longest Palindromic Substring

Problem Statement:
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Input:
A string s.

Output:
The longest palindromic substring.

Example:
Input:
s = "babad"
Output:
"bab" or "aba"

3. Problem: Maximum Subarray Sum Circular

Problem Statement:
Given a circular integer array nums of length n, return the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of nums.

Input:
A circular integer array nums.

Output:
The maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray.

Example:
Input:
nums = [1,-2,3,-2]
Output:
3
