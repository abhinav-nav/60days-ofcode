Day 1: Sorting and Dynamic Programming Challenge

Easy Problem: Bubble Sort Implementation

1.Problem Statement:
Write a function or method to sort an array of integers using the bubble sort algorithm.

Input:
An array of integers.

Output:
The sorted array.

Example:
Input:
[3, 1, 4, 2, 5]
Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2. Problem: Merge Sort Implementation

Problem Statement:
Write a function or method to sort an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm.

Input:
An array of integers.

Output:
The sorted array.

Example:
Input:
[6, 4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 5]
Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

3. Problem: Longest Increasing Subsequence

Problem Statement:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Input:
An array of integers.

Output:
The length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Example:
Input:
[10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
Output:
6 (The LIS is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80])
