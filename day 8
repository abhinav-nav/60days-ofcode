Day 8: Strings and Backtracking
1. Problem: Reverse a String

Problem Statement:
Write a function to reverse a string.

Input:
A string.

Output:
The reversed string.

Example:
Input:
"hello"
Output:
"olleh"

2. Problem: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number**

Problem Statement:
Given a string containing digits from 2-9 representing a phone's keypad, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

Input:
A string containing digits from 2-9.

Output:
All possible letter combinations as a list of strings.

Example:
Input:
"23"
Output:
["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]

3. Problem: Regular Expression Matching**

Problem Statement:
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'. '.' matches any single character, and '*' matches zero or more of the preceding element.

Input:
A string (s) and a pattern (p).

Output:
Return true if the input string matches the pattern, otherwise return false.

Example:
Input:
s = "aab"
p = "c*a*b"
Output:
true

These questions cover string manipulation and backtracking, providing a variety of challenges for Day 8.
