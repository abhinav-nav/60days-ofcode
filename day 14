Day 14: Trees and Graphs

1. Problem: Check if Binary Tree is Symmetric

Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree, determine if it is symmetric around its center.

Input:
A binary tree.

Output:
True if the binary tree is symmetric, otherwise false.

Example:
Input:
1
/
2 2
/ \ /
3 4 4 3
Output:
True

2.  Problem: Maximum Subarray

Problem Statement:
Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum and return its sum.

Input:
An array of integers.

Output:
The sum of the maximum subarray.

Example:
Input:
[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output:
6 (Subarray: [4, -1, 2, 1])

3. Problem: Course Schedule

Problem Statement:
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1. Some courses may have prerequisites, for example, to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]. Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Input:
The total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs.

Output:
True if it is possible to finish all courses, otherwise false.

Example:
Input:
numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output:
True
