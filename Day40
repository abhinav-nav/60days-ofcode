1. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

 

Example 1:

Input: left = 5, right = 7
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: left = 0, right = 0
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: left = 1, right = 2147483647
Output: 0

2. Daily Temperatures
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
Example 3:

Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
