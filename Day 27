1. N - Queens (Hard)

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such
that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. 
You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Exapmle 1 -
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

2. Trapping Rain Water(Hard)

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1- 
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
