Day 9: Linked Lists and Divide and Conquer

1. Problem: Reverse a Linked List

Problem Statement:
Write a function to reverse a linked list.

Input:
A linked list.

Output:
The reversed linked list.

Example:
Input:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output:
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

2. Problem: Merge Two Sorted Lists**

Problem Statement:
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Input:
Two sorted linked lists.

Output:
A new sorted linked list after merging the input lists.

Example:
Input:
List 1: 1 -> 2 -> 4
List 2: 1 -> 3 -> 4
Output:
1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

3. Problem: Find the Closest Pair of Points**

Problem Statement:
Given an array of points in a 2D plane, find the closest pair of points.

Input:
An array of points in a 2D plane.

Output:
The closest pair of points and their distance.

Example:
Input:
[(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]
Output:
Closest pair: (3, 4) and (5, 6)
Distance: 2.828 (approx)

These questions cover linked lists, sorting and searching, and divide and conquer techniques, providing a variety of challenges for Day 9.
