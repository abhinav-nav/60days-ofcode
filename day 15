2. Problem: Merge Intervals

Problem Statement:
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals and return the merged intervals in sorted order.

Input:
An array of intervals.

Output:
The merged intervals.

Example:
Input:
Intervals: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
